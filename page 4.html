           <p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
             Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a
              Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED,
               publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of 
               instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming
                language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.</p>

           <p> Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to 
            complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - students, hobbyists, artists
            , programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their 
            contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge that can be of 
            great help to novices and experts alike.</p>
            
            <p>Arduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast 
            prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming. As soon 
            as it reached a wider community, the Arduino board started changing to adapt to new needs and
             challenges, differentiating its offer from simple 8-bit boards to products for IoT 
             applications, wearable, 3D printing, and embedded environments.</p>

                    Why Arduino?

            </div> -->
           
           <p>Thanks to its simple and accessible user experience, Arduino has been used in thousands of 
            different projects and applications. The Arduino software is easy-to-use for beginners, yet 
            flexible enough for advanced users. It runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Teachers and students
             use it to build low cost scientific instruments, to prove chemistry and physics principles, 
             or to get started with programming and robotics. Designers and architects build interactive 
             prototypes, musicians and artists use it for installations and to experiment with new 
             musical instruments. Makers, of course, use it to build many of the projects exhibited at 
             the Maker Faire, for example. Arduino is a key tool to learn new things. Anyone - children, 
             hobbyists, artists, programmers - can start tinkering just following the step by step 
             instructions of a kit, or sharing ideas online with other members of the Arduino community.</p>
