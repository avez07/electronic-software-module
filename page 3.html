           <p>The Raspberry Pi hardware has evolved through several versions that feature variations in 
            the type of the central processing unit, amount of memory capacity, networking support, and 
            peripheral-device support.

            This block diagram describes models B, B+, A and A+. The Pi Zero models are similar, but lack
             the Ethernet and USB hub components. The Ethernet adapter is internally connected to an 
             additional USB port. In Model A, A+, and the Pi Zero, the USB port is connected directly to
              the system on a chip (SoC). On the Pi 1 Model B+ and later models the USB/Ethernet chip 
              contains a five-port USB hub, of which four ports are available, while the Pi 1 Model B
               only provides two. On the Pi Zero, the USB port is also connected directly to the SoC,
                but it uses a micro USB (OTG) port. Unlike all other Pi models, the 40 pin GPIO connector
                 is omitted on the Pi Zero, with solderable through-holes only in the pin locations. The
                  Pi Zero WH remedies this.
            
            Processor speed ranges from 700 MHz to 1.4 GHz for the Pi 3 Model B+ or 1.5 GHz for the Pi 4;
             on-board memory ranges from 256 MB to 8 GB random-access memory (RAM), with only the 
             Raspberry Pi 4 having more than 1 GB. Secure Digital (SD) cards in MicroSDHC form factor 
             (SDHC on early models) are used to store the operating system and program memory, however
              some models also come with onboard eMMC storage and the Raspberry Pi 4 can also make 
              use of USB-attached SSD storage for its operating system. The boards have one to five 
              USB ports. For video output, HDMI and composite video are supported, with a standard 3.5 mm
               tip-ring-sleeve jack carrying mono audio together with composite video. Lower-level output
                is provided by a number of GPIO pins, which support common protocols like IÂ²C.
                 The B-models have an 8P8C Ethernet port and the Pi 3, Pi 4 and Pi Zero W have on-board
                  Wi-Fi 802.11n and Bluetooth.</p>

                    The Raspberry Pi 2B uses a 32-bit 900 MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 processor.
                    The Broadcom BCM2835 SoC used in the first generation Raspberry Pi[53] includes a 700 
                    MHz 32-bit ARM1176JZF-S processor, VideoCore IV graphics processing unit (GPU) and RAM. It has a level 1 (L1) cache of 16 KB and a level 2 (L2) cache of 128 KB. The level 2 cache is used primarily by the GPU. The SoC is stacked underneath the RAM chip, so only its edge is visible. The ARM1176JZ(F)-S is the same CPU used in the original iPhone,[55] although at a higher clock rate, and mated with a much faster GPU.
                    
                    The earlier V1.1 model of the Raspberry Pi 2 used a Broadcom BCM2836 SoC with a 900 MHz 32-bit, quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 processor, with 256 KB shared L2 cache.[56] The Raspberry Pi 2 V1.2 was upgraded to a Broadcom BCM2837 SoC with a 1.2 GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor,[24] the same one which is used on the Raspberry Pi 3, but underclocked (by default) to the same 900 MHz CPU clock speed as the V1.1. The BCM2836 SoC is no longer in production as of late 2016.
                    
                    The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B uses a Broadcom BCM2837 SoC with a 1.2 GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor, with 512 KB shared L2 cache. The Model A+ and B+ are 1.4 GHz[57][58][59]
                    
                    The Raspberry Pi 4 uses a Broadcom BCM2711 SoC with a 1.5 GHz (later models: 1.8 GHz) 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 processor, with 1 MB shared L2 cache.[60][61] Unlike previous models, which all used a custom interrupt controller poorly suited for virtualisation, the interrupt controller on this SoC is compatible with the ARM Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) architecture 2.0, providing hardware support for interrupt distribution when using ARM virtualisation capabilities.[62][63]
                    
                    The Raspberry Pi Zero and Zero W use the same Broadcom BCM2835 SoC as the first generation Raspberry Pi, although now running at 1 GHz CPU clock speed.[64]
                    
                    The Raspberry Pi Zero W 2 uses the RP3A0-AU CPU, a 1 GHz 64 bit ARM Cortex A53, on 512MB of SDRAM. Documentation states this "system-on-package" is a Broadcom BCM2710A1 package, using a BCM2837 Broadcom chip as core, which is an ARM v8 quad-core. The Raspberry Pi 3 also uses the BCM2837, but clocked at 1.2 GHz.
                    
                    The Raspberry Pi Pico uses the RP2040 running at 133 MHz.
