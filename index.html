            Raspberry Pi  is a series of small single-board computers developed in the
             United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom.[14] The Raspberry
              Pi project originally leaned towards the promotion of teaching basic computer science in
               schools and in developing countries.The original model became more popular 
               than anticipated,selling outside its target market for uses such as robotics. It is
                widely used in many areas, such as for weather monitoring, because of its low cost,
                 modularity, and open design. It is typically used by computer and electronic hobbyists,
                  due to its adoption of the HDMI and USB standards.<br>
                    After the release of the second board type, the Raspberry Pi Foundation set up a new 
                    entity, named Raspberry Pi Trading, and installed Eben Upton as CEO, with the 
                    responsibility of developing technology.The Foundation was rededicated as an 
                    educational charity for promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools
                     and developing countries. Most Pis are made in a Sony factory in Pencoed, Wales,[21]
                      while others are made in China and Japan.<br>
            There are three series of Raspberry Pi, and several generations of each have been released.
            Raspberry Pi SBCs feature a Broadcom system on a chip (SoC) with an integrated ARM-compatible 
            central processing unit (CPU) and on-chip graphics processing unit (GPU), while Raspberry Pi
             Pico has a RP2040 system on chip with an integrated ARM-compatible central processing unit (CPU).
